# Bradley Best Resume Page
Milestone Project One: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my resume web page, it offer's potential employers or fellow developers wanting to collaborate a chance to view my skills, see past projects and learn more about me, whilst also offering a central contact space for anyone wanting to send me a message.

### Demo

A live demo can be found <a href="https://brad000.github.io/Resume-project/" TARGET="_blank">here.</a>

### UX
---
My goal for the design was to create a modern but professional feel, i choose the blue/black colour scheme as i felt this achieved that. I also wanted to showcase information in a clear and concise manner with definitive breaks in the content to allow users to know exactly what information they are viewing. 

I created a multi page site as i felt this was good way to be clear on each aspect of the design and content. For potential recruiters i wanted to give them a insight to me on an individual level, as well as showcase my skills and current learning schedule. I grouped the content on each page together in a way so that each piece was relevant to the other. The about me and skills section linked nicely together, whilst the work history and why web developemt? section was a chance to give an insight in to why i choose this career path. 

I also provided a project portfolio so i can continue to present my project via my website as i get futher into my journey. Each project can be quickly accessed by the "See Project" button. (Due to only having one current project the links and subject are temporary to demonstrate usage.)

There is a contact link in the footer along with a downloadable CV, and several social links.

### Features
---
  * The nav bar occupies the top of the screen with four routes of navigation to allow ease for the user to flow through the site. On smaller screen devices the page labels are always visable, on larger screens the are not visable until the mouse is hovered over to create a nice visual effect.
  * The skills progress bars have a filling transition when the "about-me" page is loaded to visually stimulate the user to take this information in. they are colour coded to reflect my current level of skill with a more noticable soft red to represent any current areas I am still learning. 
  * The project portfolio page has six card representing project i have and will be completing. on smaller screen devices these cards are always at full opacity to allow to be clearly seen. On larger screen devices they are more transparent and come to life when hovered over, this is to allow the user to focus on what they want when viewing project cards. 
  * The contact me button is located in the footer and directs the user at any time clicked to a contact me form with the required fields of "name", "email" and "Message" whilst also allowing them to distinguish themselves between recruiter or collaborator.
