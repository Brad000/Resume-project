# Bradley Best Resume Page
Milestone Project One: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my resume web page, it offer's potential employers or fellow developers wanting to collaborate a chance to view my skills, see past projects and learn more about me, whilst also offering a central contact space for anyone wanting to send me a message.

### Demo

A live demo can be found <a href="https://brad000.github.io/Resume-project/">here.</a>

### UX
---
My goal for the design was to create a modern but professional feel, i choose the blue/black colour scheme as i felt this achieved that. I also wanted to showcase information in a clear and concise manner with definitive breaks in the content to allow users to know exactly what information they are viewing.
