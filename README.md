# Bradley Best Resume Page
Milestone Project One: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my resume web page, it offer's potential employers or fellow developers wanting to collaborate a chance to view my skills, see past projects and learn more about me, whilst also offering a central contact space for anyone wanting to send me a message.

### Demo
---
A live demo can be found <a href="https://brad000.github.io/Resume-project/" TARGET="_blank">here.</a>

### UX
---
My goal for the design was to create a modern but professional feel, I choose the blue/black colour scheme as I felt this achieved that. I also wanted to showcase information in a clear and concise manner with definitive breaks in the content to allow users to know exactly what information they are viewing. 

I created a multi-page site as I felt this was good way to be clear on each aspect of the design and content. For potential recruiters I wanted to give them an insight to me on an individual level, as well as showcase my skills and current learning schedule. I grouped the content on each page together in a way so that each piece was relevant to the other. The about me and skills section linked nicely together, whilst the work history and why web development? section was a chance to give an insight in to why I choose this career path. 

I also provided a project portfolio so I can continue to present my project via my website as I get further into my journey. Each project can be quickly accessed by the "See Project" button. (Due to only having one current project the links and subject are temporary to demonstrate usage.)

There is a contact link in the footer along with a downloadable CV, and several social links. 


### Technologies 
---
1.HTML  
2.CSS  
3.Bootstrap (4.3.x)  

### Features
---
  * The nav bar occupies the top of the screen with four routes of navigation to allow ease for the user to flow through the site. On smaller screen devices the page labels are always visible, on larger screens they are not visible until the mouse is hovered over to create a nice visual effect.
  * The skills progress bars have a filling transition when the "about-me" page is loaded to visually stimulate the user to take this information in. they are colour coded to reflect my current level of skill with a more noticeable soft red to represent any current areas I am still learning. 
  * The project portfolio page has six card representing project I have and will be completing. on smaller screen devices these cards are always at full opacity to allow to be clearly seen. On larger screen devices they are more transparent and come to life when hovered over, this is to allow the user to focus on what they want when viewing project cards. 
  * The contact me button is in the footer and directs the user at any time clicked to a contact me form with the required fields of "name", "email" and "Message" whilst also allowing them to distinguish themselves between recruiter or collaborator. 

#### Features Left to Implement
---
  * Replace temp project on project portfolio with my own as they are completed.
  * Turn the contact page into a modal pop out when the contact me button is clicked.
  * Project portfolio page to have live and repository links once more projects are added. 

### Testing
---
I tested the theme and subject of the website with various people and it landed well, the feedback was that the intended audience of recruiters and collaborators was clear, the landing page offers a nice visual backdrop as the home of the webpage with no content to declutter and focus the user on what they want to achieve on their visit. The about me page gives a brief insight into me as an individual on a professional and a personal level, the skills section give a visual representation of my skills with brief descriptions of the skill sets underneath. 

Work history page shows a timeline of previous and current workplaces and positions, whilst the why web development section allows users to have a better understanding into the career path choice. The project portfolio page uses project cards to give the user a project title, brief insight into the project and a link button to that project. currently there is only one true project the rest are linked to display the sites functions. if you are viewing this on desktop the cards are more transparent until hovered over.

There are links to my social media in the footer and a downloadable CV which uses the attribute "download" to download it to your default file. The contact button directs you to a contact form this has been tested and all fields have the set attribute "required". If you type an invalid email address you will receive an error message, similarly if you do not submit text into the name, email or message fields a required message will show. 

All links have been tested and direct you in the intended direction, all links will open in a new tab this is achieve with the ```target="blank"``` attribute. 

Browser testing: 

 * Chrome 
 * Firefox
 * Safari
 * Internet Explorer

Device testing:

 * iPhone 8,9, X & 11 
 * Pixel 2,3 & XL 
 * Galaxy 10 
 * iPad 

All the above tested well for responsiveness and functionality.

### Deployment
---
The site is hosted on GitHub pages. It is deployed directly from the master branch and is automatically updated whenever there is a commit to that branch. ```index.html``` must be the landing page for it to deploy correctly through GitHub pages. 

To run this code locally you can clone it into your editor by typing ```git clone https://github.com/Brad000/Resume-project``` you can cut ties with by typing ``` git remote rm origin```.
